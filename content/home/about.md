# Biography

I am currently enrolled as a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior to this, I was working as a Senior Software Engineer at Myntra Designs Pvt. Ltd. for 3 years, with a key focus on highly available and scalable services.

I have hands-on experience working with Java, Play Framework, Tomcat, Maven, MySQL, Spring, Hibernate & RabbitMQ, and am also fluent in C & C++.

I also maintain a [tech-blog](https://medium.com/calvin-codes), publishing my findings on the issues I faced while using some of these frameworks.
