  Projects:
  
  * Decoupled order taking & order processing services using message-queueing via RabbitMQ. Achieved scalability of handling ∼150,000 requests/min in the Java based order taking service & processing ∼1,000,000 (1M) messages/min using RabbitMQ. Detailed analysis is available on my [tech blog](https://medium.com/calvin-codes/using-spring-rabbit-under-high-throughput-520ff76d3dd6).
  * Built an asynchronous micro-service in Play, capable of taking ∼10,000 requests/min on a single server with a response time of ∼100 ms. It is being used to identify optimal warehouse during order checkout.
  * Built a micro-service in Play, for customer order consolidation, saving ∼$700,000/day of supply chain cost.
  * Designed invoice generation module for customer orders, using Java and Apache Velocity. Also identified a bug in Velocity and published its workaround on my [tech blog](https://medium.com/calvin-codes/velocity-could-not-be-initialised-but-why-514f7708cc13).
